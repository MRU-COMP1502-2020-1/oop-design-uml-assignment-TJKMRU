Question 3 Answer

I would consider the second one the better option considering it's the most using the objects methods.
You can use the information that the name is null for error trapping after through processing
but the initial error trapping doesn't actually happen due to how direct the access to the name is with 'ob.name'.
It bypasses the conditionals that let the user know that the name has been added as null.

Question 4 Answer

The way data is accessed doesn't give any errors. 
What if the pathIP is wrong? There are no failed returns.
Conditionals should be added like within the A and B programs to return a message 
saying what they're looking for doesn't exist or what they're trying to do isn't
what this is designed to do.



class MyReader {
    // -------------- unrelated functions
    public boolean validateLocation(String pathIP) { // I think this is fine as it just checks if both are either true or false
         return ping(pathIP) && checkFTP(pathIP);
    }
    private boolean checkFTP(String pathIP) {
		boolean output = true;
		if(pathIP == null) {
		output = false;
			System.out.println("That IP is null so output is now false");
		}
		else{
        return output;
		}
    }

    private boolean ping(String pathIP) {
		boolean output = true;
		if(pathIP == null) {
		output = false;
			System.out.println("That IP is null so output is now false");
		}
        return output;
    }

    // -------------- functions related to read resource
	//Added conditions to each method so they check for null
    // read the resource from disk
    public String readFromDisk(String fileName) {
		
		if(fileName == null) {
			return "That files null";
		}
        else {
			return "data of " + fileName;
		}
    }

    // read the resource from web
    public String readFromWeb(String url) {
